"""
Tests for airgap_proof.py — P1.2 Air-gap zero-egress proof.

These tests run the air-gap proof and assert zero network egress.
The proof uses REAL socket monkey-patching to intercept any attempted
connection — no mocks on the production path.

Tests verify:
1. A document session completes in air-gap mode with zero egress.
2. Zero DNS lookups occur.
3. If code attempts a connection, it is caught and recorded.
4. The egress monitor blocks real socket calls (not a no-op).
5. The grounding pipeline works correctly under air-gap constraints.
